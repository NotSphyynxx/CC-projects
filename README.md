## 📜 About

Welcome to my **42 Common Core** repository. This repo contains all the projects I have completed during my curriculum at **1337** (part of the 42 Network).

The 42 curriculum is a project-based peer-learning program. There are no teachers and no classes. We learn by reading documentation, coding, and peer-reviewing. This repository serves as an archive of my progress, covering everything from the C standard library to C++ Object-Oriented Programming, networking, and system administration.
